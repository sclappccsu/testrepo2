2nd line in readme
3rd line to see what happens since already staged
4th line to see in 2nd go round when staged 3rd line but not 4th, can I just git add before commit & consolidate 3rd & 4th for the commit?
I'm going to add in a line below 4th in the feature2 branch and delete a couple lines. In the issue1? branch there are lines 5-7 and a bunch of copies of line 7 in it. I committed them already.
